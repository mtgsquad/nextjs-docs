# Getting Started
The mCloud Has 2 Ways To Start, One Of Them Is Longer, Other Is More Prefered.

### Our Prefered Method:
Make your site on premise, once done, just use FTP to upload, 1 thing is, that you'll have to make a FTP account when adding your domain name to your hosting account.

### Longer Method:
Just use the file explorer, and code it inside the browser, it isn't recommended since you'll have problems navigating between files.

### Alternative To Coding:
Just install an app like wordpress, or use the sitepad website builder.

## Requirements:
1: Hosting Account On mCloud (Free!)
2: An FTP Client
3: A Website, Which Is Prebuilt (Optional)
4: HTML5, CSS3, And JavaScript Skills (Not Really Needed, Unless You're Coding Yourself)
5: WordPress Or SitePad Installed From Softaculous App Installer. (Optional)
